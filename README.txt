Simpleton is a simple VST instrument plugin (VSTi).

The goal is to create a synth with the following features:
 - polyphony
 - multi-timbral voice generation
 - basic envelopes

This project requires the VST SDK 2.4.2, which is not included here due to licensing restrictions.  You can download the SDK here:

http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/3rd_party_developer.html

Place the contents of the SDK zipfile underneath the "vstsdk2.4" directory, and do NOT push it back to github.
